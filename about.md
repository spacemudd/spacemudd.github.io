I am a software developer having been a freelancer since circa 2009. I have been fascinated by technology and especially tools for automation, analysing, and interperting information.

Before this fascination, I was a massive geek about avaiation (having 5000+ hours on FSX). 

Alas, the urge settled when I realized I could achieve more in a totally different field:

Bioinformatics. My end goal is to be a part of a lab that deals with this field. There's something I can't put my finger on that makes me happy when I can use code with biological data.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shafiqalshaar) anytime.
