After grueling development time of 10 months for Arab National bank - ANB,
the system is now shining bright for them.

One of the main pain points was not having a instant way to figure out what assets 
are under an employee's custody.

You can imagine how critical knowing this information when you are issuing new IT assets to former employees.

Or worse, imagine an employee decided to leave; without an instant method to pull their 
assets in custody, they could simply forget about it (and so will you).

I'm proud my work is production-ready, and officially running in ANB.

Perhaps I could make a case study about it.
